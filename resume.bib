	Abstract = {Polyethylenimine (PEI), a cationic polymer, has been widely studied and shown great promise as an efficient gene delivery vehicle. Likewise, the HIV-1 Tat peptide, a cell-permeable peptide, has been successfully used for intracellular gene delivery. To improve the favorable properties of these two vectors, we combine PEI with the modified Tat peptide sequence bearing histidine and cysteine residues (mTat). In vitro mTat/PEI-mediated transfection was evaluated by luciferase expression plasmid in two cell types. mTat/PEI produced significant improvement (≈5-fold) in transfection efficiency of both cell lines with little cytotoxicity when compared to mTat alone, PEI alone, or four commercial reagents. The particle size of mTat/PEI/DNA complex was significantly smaller than mTat or PEI alone, and it was correlated with higher transfection efficiency. Filipin III, an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, significantly inhibited mTat/PEI transfection. In contrast, chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, did not. This suggested caveolae-mediated endocytosis as the transfection mechanism. Furthermore, the results of in vivo studies showed that animals administered mTat/PEI/DNA intramuscularly had significantly higher and longer luciferase expression (≈7 months) than those with mTat/DNA, PEI/DNA, or DNA alone, without any associated toxicity. The combination of mTat with PEI could significantly improve transfection efficiency, expanding the potential use as a non-viral gene vector both in vitro and in vivo.},

@article{Yuvienco:2012sf,
	Abstract = {Here we describe the biosynthesis and characterization of fluorinated protein block polymers comprised of the two self-assembling domains (SADs): elastin (E) and the coiled-coil region of cartilage oligomeric matrix proteins (C). Fluorination is achieved by residue-specific incorporation of p-fluorophenylalanine (pFF) to create pFF-EC, pFF-CE, and pFF-ECE. Global fluorination results in downstream effects on the temperature-dependent secondary structure, supramolecular assembly, and bulk mechanical properties. The impact of fluorination on material properties also differs depending on the orientation of the block configurations as well as the number of domains in the fusion. These studies suggest that integration of fluorinated amino acids within protein materials can be employed to tune the material properties, especially mechanical integrity.},

@article{Yamano:2011nr,
	Abstract = {The HIV-1 Tat peptide has been successfully used for intracellular gene delivery. Likewise, various lipid-based methods have shown increased endocytosis and can influence endosomal escape. This study combines the favorable properties of Tat peptide with that of lipid systems for DNA delivery. We combined the lipid FuGENE HD (FH) with the Tat peptide sequence modified with histidine and cysteine residues (mTat). mTat/FH transfection was evaluated by luciferase expression plasmid in five cell types. mTat/FH produced significant improvement in transfection efficiency of all cell lines when compared to FH or mTat. Treatment with chloroquine, associated with energy-dependent endocytosis, significantly increased transfection efficiency with mTat/FH while incubation at low temperature decreased it. The zeta potential of mTat/FH/DNA was significantly higher compared to FH, mTat, or their DNA combination in the presence of serum, and it was correlated with transfection efficiency. The particle size of the FH/DNA complex was significantly reduced by addition of mTat. Filipin III, an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, significantly inhibited mTat/FH transfection, but transfection was increased by chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These findings demonstrated the feasibility of using a combination of mTat with lipids, utilizing temperature-dependent and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, as a potentially attractive non-viral gene vector.},

@article{Haghpanah:2010xy,
	Abstract = {Genetically engineered protein block polymers are an important class of biomaterials that have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in biotechnology, electronics and medicine. The majority of the protein materials have been composed of at least a single self-assembling domain (SAD), enabling the formation of supramolecular structures. Recently, we developed block polymers consisting of two distinct SADs derived from an elastin-mimetic polypeptide (E) and the alpha-helical COMPcc (C). These protein polymers, synthesized as the block sequences--EC, CE, and ECE--were assessed for overall conformation and macroscopic thermoresponsive behavior. Here, we investigate the supramolecular assembly as well as the small molecule binding and release profile of these block polymers. Our results demonstrate that the protein polymers assemble into particles as well as fully or partially networked structures in a concentration dependent manner that is distinct from the individual E and C homopolymers and the E+C non-covalent mixture. In contrast to synthetic block polymers, the structured assembly, binding and release abilities are highly dependent on the composition and orientation of the blocks. These results reveal the promise for these block polymers for therapeutic delivery and biomedical scaffolds.},
